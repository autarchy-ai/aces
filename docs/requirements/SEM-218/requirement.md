# SEM-218 — Explicitness And Realization Semantics

## Statement

The ecosystem shall define semantics distinguishing binding author declarations from concerns left open to processor or backend realization, including when realization is permitted, when explicit declarations must be honored, and when unsupported exact requirements must be rejected rather than silently approximated.

## Rationale

Current state: identified gap. Honest portability requires normative semantics for what is binding, what may be realized later, and when approximation is forbidden.
