# ASR-530 — Claim Falsification And Evidence Gate

## Statement

The ecosystem shall treat major architecture and maturity claims as unproven until each claim has an explicit falsification protocol, objective pass/fail criteria, named evidence artifacts, and a recorded evidence status that distinguishes demonstrated, partially demonstrated, untested, and refuted claims.

## Rationale

Agent-assisted development can produce internally coherent code and documentation that still overstates real ecosystem maturity. RAES needs a ruthless credibility gate so claims such as backend agnosticism, independent backend implementability, conformance honesty, backend substitution, provenance separation, and processor artifact portability are evaluated through pre-registered tests and evidence rather than architectural confidence or reference-code self-consistency.
