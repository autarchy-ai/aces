# Contribute to RAES

RAES SDL is a research-oriented engineering project. Contributions are useful
when they make the language, reference implementation, contracts, examples, or
documentation more precise and easier to validate.

## Choose the right route

- For a small docs fix, typo fix, or narrow test improvement, a pull request
  is enough. Use `No issue: <brief reason>` in its Issue tracking section.
- For SDL language changes, contract changes, processor behavior changes, or
  backend conformance changes, open an issue first and reference it with a
  standalone `Refs #N` line when the issue's Requirements section declares
  requirement UIDs, or `Closes #N` otherwise. Those changes can affect authored scenario
  meaning and generated artifacts.
- Keep unrelated work in separate pull requests.
- Base pull requests on `dev`, not `main`. `main` is the stable release line;
  `dev` is the integration branch.

Requirement-backed issues stay open at merge. The delivery workflow verifies
the merged requirement status and traceability, records its final report, and
then closes the issue. Do not add closing keywords elsewhere in the PR body to
circumvent that verification. The body guard checks scope from the linked issue,
not from a self-declaration in the PR. Keep the plain-language Context, Problem
and Fix bullets and substantive Verification evidence. The tracking heading may
be `Issue tracking` or the workflow renderer's `Related Issues`; the former
`Issues closed` heading remains compatible on existing PRs.

The body guard normally executes the validator from the PR's base revision.
The requirement-aware policy migration admits exactly one legacy validator
digest and a pinned two-file validator bundle, with an independent SHA-256 check
of each Git blob before execution. This lets the introducing PR be validated without executing
PR-head code or bypassing policy. Once the replacement lands on `dev`, the
legacy digest no longer matches and the normal base-validator path applies.
Changing these migration pins is an explicit, reviewable workflow trust change.

## Set up the repository

Prerequisites:

- a standard CPython 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, or 3.14 payload admitted by the
  [development profile](implementations/tooling/README.md); 3.14t is preview-only
- the exact uv payload selected by the development artifact lock

The host profile also requires Git, trusted CA roots, SHA-256 tooling, GH CLI
when GitHub operations are used, and curl 8.4.0 or newer with verified
unknown-length size enforcement. An older client is a hard failure for generic
artifact acquisition. Provision native prerequisites from the reviewed host
image or repository snapshot; the offline payload kit supplies exact Python,
uv, and generic-tool objects after those prerequisites are present. Do not pipe
a remote installer into a shell.

Install the separate locked project and verification-tool environments:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/OpenRAE/rae.git
cd rae
uv sync --project implementations/python --all-extras --frozen
uv sync --project implementations/tooling/python --frozen --no-default-groups
```

The [developer documentation index](docs/README.md) links to architecture,
research, migration, release, and workflow records that are not part of the
hosted reader guide.

## Make a change

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `dev`.
2. Make the smallest coherent change that solves the issue.
3. Add or update tests when behavior changes.
4. Update examples, schemas, contracts, or documentation when the public
   surface changes.
5. For public docs changes, follow
   [`docs/explain/reference/documentation-style-guide.md`](docs/explain/reference/documentation-style-guide.md).
6. Use a [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) PR title,
   such as `feat:` or `fix:`. Release Please reads that title.
7. Run the relevant checks locally.
8. Open a pull request against `dev` with a concrete description of what
   changed and why.

## Run the checks

The full repository gate is:

```shell
uv run --project implementations/tooling/python --frozen --no-default-groups nox -f noxfile.py -s verify
```

That gate includes a `participant-opacity-proof` lane, which replays the pinned
Isabelle proof offline. The lane runs on Linux x86_64 only. It needs
`bubblewrap` to enforce the offline replay, and a fontconfig setup with at least
one installed font, because Isabelle starts a JVM that will not run without one:

```shell
sudo apt-get install bubblewrap fontconfig fonts-dejavu-core
```

The proof tool checks this fontconfig runtime before entering the sandbox and
reports a missing prerequisite separately from a kernel rejection. Run the
gate on Linux, or rely on continuous integration, when your workstation is
another platform.

Some Linux security policies also deny unprivileged user or network namespaces.
The proof tool reports that condition as unavailable bubblewrap isolation and
does not retry without the network sandbox. Use an administrator-approved host
policy for bubblewrap or rely on continuous integration; do not disable the
offline boundary to make the lane pass.

Run the change-aware local gate while iterating:

```shell
uv run --project implementations/tooling/python --frozen --no-default-groups nox -f noxfile.py -s verify-changed
```

It selects from status-aware changes against the branch's upstream ref and
fails closed to the full local gate when classification is uncertain. The
pre-push hook uses this lane. It does not weaken `verify`, which remains the
unconditional pull-request gate.

Useful narrower sessions:

```shell
uv run --project implementations/tooling/python --frozen --no-default-groups nox -f noxfile.py -s tests
uv run --project implementations/tooling/python --frozen --no-default-groups nox -f noxfile.py -s docs
uv run --project implementations/tooling/python --frozen --no-default-groups nox -f noxfile.py -l
```

Run the full gate before requesting review for language, contract, generated
artifact, or shared runtime changes.

## Let Release Please write the changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` is generated by
[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) from the
Conventional Commit history on `main`; do not hand-edit it or add changelog
fragments. The Conventional Commit PR title is the entry release-please reads.
See [`docs/explain/releasing.md`](docs/explain/releasing.md).
